Evaluation Function for non-terminal leaf nodes: Is the amount of spaces that will be occupied by the move.
In this program's case it is (current spaces available - move's spaces available)

Minimax Algorithm

Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
depth level 2
Number of nodes expanded: 2975

depth level 3
Number of nodes expanded: 17777
